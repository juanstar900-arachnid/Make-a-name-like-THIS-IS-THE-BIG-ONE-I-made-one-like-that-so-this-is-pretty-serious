    "\n",
    "**Describe the problem you're addressing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cybersecurity systems must scan huge amounts of network traffic and encrypted data to detect threats like hackers, malware, and data breaches. Classical computers analyze this data step-by-step, which becomes slow and inefficient as data grows larger and attacks become more complex. At the same time, current encryption methods rely on math problems that are hard for classical computers but could be broken by future quantum computers. This creates a serious risk: our current defenses may not be strong enough in the future. We need faster threat detection and new types of secure encryption to keep data safe.\n",

    "[In future, people will harvest data which they plan to decrypt later as Quantum technolgy improves.

    "\n",
    " Because the qubits cannot be described independently, any attempt by a hacker to \"intercept\" or \"measure\" one qubit instantly collapses the entanglement and changes the state of the other. This creates a physical \"alarm\" that alerts the system to the breach before any data is actually stolen.\n",

    "\n",
    "Interference is the idea that quantum states behave like waves. When a qubit can be in a position of 0 and 1, each possible state acts like a wave. These waves interfere with each other. Constructive interference waves reinforce each other, and destructive interference waves cancel each other out. In cyber security this process can be used to destruct \"bad paths\" and let \"good paths\" survive, furthermore, it's what makes algorithms like Shor's algorithm and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm work, which lets us simulate attackers.\n",
