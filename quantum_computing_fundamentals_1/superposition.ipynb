    "**In my own words:**\n",
    "\n",
    "[Quantum interference is how quantum states combine and cancel each other out because of their phases. Instead of just adding probabilities like classical systems, quantum amplitudes can interfere constructively or destructively, making some outcomes more likely and others disappear entirely.]\n",

    "**What does the Z gate do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "[ The Z gate flips the phase of the |1⟩ state while leaving |0⟩ unchanged. It does not change the measurement value directly, but it changes how the state will interfere later. This phase flip is crucial for quantum algorithms like Deutsch-Jozsa because it enables interference.]\n",

At the same time, current encryption methods rely on math problems that are hard for classical computers but could be broken by future quantum computers.

    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "Being in multiple states allows Quantum comptuters to simultaneously search, test, and and analyze security spaces faster than classcial computer systems, which is critical for detecting cyber threats and building future-proof encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, people will harvest data which they plan to decrypt later as Quantum technolgy improves. This is a significant because attackers may currently store encrypted sensitive information with the intention of decrypting it later once quantum technology has advanced sufficiently. This poses a long-term threat to the confidentiality of data.\n",

    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how qubits that can't be described independently help solve your problem]\n",
    "\n",
    " Because the qubits cannot be described independently, any attempt by a hacker to \"intercept\" or \"measure\" one qubit instantly collapses the entanglement and changes the state of the other. This creates a physical \"alarm\" that alerts the system to the breach before any data is actually stolen.\n",
    "---\n",

    "### [ ] Interference\n",
    "\n",
    "Interference is the idea that quantum states behave like waves. When a qubit can be in a position of 0 and 1, each possible state acts like a wave. These waves interfere with each other. Constructive interference waves reinforce each other, and destructive interference waves cancel each other out. In cyber security this process can be used to destruct \"bad paths\" and let \"good paths\" survive, furthermore, it's what makes algorithms like Shor's algorithm and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm work, which lets us simulate attackers.\n",

    "If quantum-based security succeeds, we could protect sensitive data like banking, healthcare, and government information even against future quantum attacks. Cybersecurity systems could also detect threats faster and more accurately. This would make the internet and digital systems much safer in the long term.\n",
