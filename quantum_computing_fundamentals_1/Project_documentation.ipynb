    "## 🎯 THE PROBLEM (Classical Thinking Approach)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Describe the problem you're addressing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern cybersecurity systems must scan huge amounts of network traffic and encrypted data to detect threats like hackers, malware, and data breaches. Classical computers analyze this data step-by-step, which becomes slow and inefficient as data grows larger and attacks become more complex. At the same time, current encryption methods rely on math problems that are hard for classical computers but could be broken by future quantum computers. This creates a serious risk: our current defenses may not be strong enough in the future. We need faster threat detection and new types of secure encryption to keep data safe.\n",

    "## 🌀 QUANTUM THINKING SHIFT\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does quantum thinking change your perspective on this problem?**\n",
    "Classical computers are becoming outdated the more we progress into the future. As we reach torwards the next steps of technology, quantum computing becomes more of a necessity for the prevention of things like hackers.**Before Learning Quantum Computing:**\n",
    "I thought the only way to improve cybersecurity was to make classical computers faster and write better algorithms that scan data step-by-step.\n",
    "**After Learning Quantum Principles:**\n",
    "I realized quantum computers can process many possibilities at the same time using superposition and can use interference to highlight correct results, which could make threat detection faster and change how encryption works.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Check all quantum concepts that apply to your project and explain HOW each one connects:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Superposition\n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "Being in multiple states allows Quantum comptuters to simultaneously search, test, and and analyze security spaces faster than classcial computer systems, which is critical for detecting cyber threats and building future-proof encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the future, people will harvest data which they plan to decrypt later as Quantum technolgy improves. This is a significant because attackers may currently store encrypted sensitive information with the intention of decrypting it later once quantum technology has advanced sufficiently. This poses a long-term threat to the confidentiality of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Entanglement  \n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how qubits that can't be described independently help solve your problem]\n",
    "\n",
    " Because the qubits cannot be described independently, any attempt by a hacker to \"intercept\" or \"measure\" one qubit instantly collapses the entanglement and changes the state of the other. This creates a physical \"alarm\" that alerts the system to the breach before any data is actually stolen.\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Interference\n",
    "\n",
    "Interference is the idea that quantum states behave like waves. When a qubit can be in a position of 0 and 1, each possible state acts like a wave. These waves interfere with each other. Constructive interference waves reinforce each other, and destructive interference waves cancel each other out. In cyber security this process can be used to destruct \"bad paths\" and let \"good paths\" survive, furthermore, it's what makes algorithms like Shor's algorithm and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm work, which lets us simulate attackers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Interference amplifies molecular structures with desired properties while canceling out poor candidates, reducing the search space dramatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### [ ] Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm\n",
    "**How it applies to my project:**\n",
    "[Explain how this algorithm concept connects - even if just as a demonstration of quantum speedup]\n",
    "The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm shows how a quantum computer can determine a global property of a function in one step instead of many, demonstrating the type of speedup that could be useful for analyzing security data and detecting patterns.\n",
